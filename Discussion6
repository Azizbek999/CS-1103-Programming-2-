What are the differences of handling Socket and ServerSocket ?
Socket :

1. Socket class is used for client side. we have to create an object of Socket class for any networking application

2. Socket class encapsulates the behavior of the active side. (i.e. the client)

3. This class implements client sockets. A socket is an endpoint for communication between two machines.

4. Socket class is available in java.net package

5. Server class, we can create like below

Socket s = new Socket(ipaddress, portnumber);

ServerSocket:

1. ServerSocket class is used for server side. we have to create an object of ServerSocket class for any networking application to support server operations.

2. ServerSocket class encapsulates the behavior of the passive side (i.e the server)

3. This ServerSoket implements server sockets. A server socket waits for requests to come in over the network from clients.

4. ServerSocket class is available in java.net package

5. ServerSocket class, we can create like this

ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(portnumber);
