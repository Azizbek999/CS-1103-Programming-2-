equals (): This method returns true if the object that is called has the same value as the object that we place an argument.
Returns true if the Date object that is called has the same value as the object we are placing as an argument. 
The advantage is that we can check two objects for equality, the disadvantage that it can be very difficult to override correctly.
I think that equality is even simpler. It is possible to determine the values to be equal, and if the result is equal, it is true, but if the result is a mistake just return in false.
